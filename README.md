Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.
This was the final project made of the bootcamp (a rails application). It was made by Hugo, Victor and Tanise.
The idea behind this project was to make avaliable to small towns a space to provide to its citizens the information that the public authority was holding, and for the public authority to have a bigger control of the citizens's personal info.
